<p>
SchedUp is a webapp designed to make scheduling events with friends and colleagues quicker and more straight forward. 
Instead of back-and-forth correspondence with a group of people, simply choose an event type, add a title
and establish a time frame for it to happen. Your invitees will then choose their optimal time slots, after which
you would pick the final hour for the event and send invites.
